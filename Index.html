	<p style="color:white;">Hello there, and welcome to my blog, The Daily Babble! Now, this blog is essentially an exercise to motivate me to code and write, so that I may expand my skillset in both. Yes, this blog is coded from scratch using HTML and Sublime Text 2! If you do not know how to code, or even what coding means or entails, and you're not interested in it, don't worry, that's not what this blog is about. (Although, I would highly recommend looking into learning how to code; it's pretty cool stuff!) This blog is simply a compialation of my random ramblings, hence the name. Each day (hopefully, or at least once a week), I will write something: a story, a limerick, a poem, simply a random peice of writing which I fondly call a babble, and post it. (I mean think about it; if The Daily Show can get away with having a name like that and not airing daily, I can get away with a babble here and there, right?) This should (key word, should) help me learn more about HTML, help me get my thoughts out and into the world, help me improve my writing skills (or lack thereof), and hopefully, entertain you to no end. So, without further ado, I present to you the mumbo jumbo dumped out from the brain of a confused teenage girl, The Daily Babble! </p>

		<p style="color:white;">So, for my first babble, I have a short peice called "A Perfect Sunset." I actually wrote this peice yesterday, (I'm already cheating, I know. Perhaps I'll make it up to you by having two babbles today. Hmm, we shall see.) but I thought it was a good peice to start off with. I showed it to two of my friends, and both of them liked it. I asked one of my friends what he thought it was about, and he remarked something along the lines of, "With a peice of writing like that, it's going to mean something different to everyone." It was an interesting statement to make, a statement that I find to be true in any peice of writing. Our experiences affect our bias, and our bias is like a lense, it affects our point of view, and thus our response to writing, or any work of art, for that matter. It is the same with the author, for that matter. My other friend noticed that my cynicism in certain matters would leak into my writing. The author's bias makes the peice something entirely different to them. The magnificence of writing is in many things, among them is the difference in interpretation, the human tendancy see things differently.</p>

			<p style="color:white;">She looked out the window, and as the sunset glided across the sky, she closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. As her eyelids brought forth the silky brown eyes of a troubled little girl, she watched the dust mites catch the sun and float along. A picture of perfection, the sky was streaked with oranges, pinks, and purples, flayed out against the lazy clouds of cotton candy drifting along.
			<br>
			The smell of home mixed with the rays of sunshine, and for a moment, everything seemed perfect. The sun was set against the backdrop of a million colors, a sea of slow downward progress left the rippling tide to drag the sun underneath the world.
			<br>
			As she watched the slow progress, she could hear the voices, the angry yells that seemed to become progressively louder, but as she  was to learn, gave no progress at all. The ghosts of voices scratched at her, but she put up a wall. She did not want to hear. She did not understand. And so she withdrew.
			<br>
			The sun burst from behind a cloud, just as it was about to reach the horizon, and her heart burst with it. The shouts enveloped her, along with the last blazing rays of the sun, and as she turned away from the window, her back soaked up the last little increments of warmth from the dying giant. Her big eyes stared stark into her home, the glazed perfection still in her eyes, but not plastered in her ears.</P>
